# Applicatioins

Robotic arms are typically used for industrial applications. The application is the type of work robot is designed to do.
Different applications will have different requirements. Industrial robots are designed for specific applications and based on their function will have their own movement, linkage dimension, control law, software and accessory packages. It can be used for welding, painting, palletizing.

# Software

<b>arduino:</b>
The movement of dc motors and the servo motor is controlled by the arduino code with the help of the feedback from the rotary encoders.

# Structure
The bot is made by joining 2 arms with base gear along with a gripper. DC motors are attached with arms and base gear to provide  motion. The whole structure is mounted on a wooden base having 4 legs. The 3D printed base is fixed with wodden base on which base gear is mounted using bearing. DC motor is attached to base gear using the controling gears along with the encoder. One arm is mounted on the base gear using shaft and bearings along with DC motor and rotory encoder.Worm gear is attached to the controlling gear to lock the arm at certain position and prvent the 2nd arm from falling. 2nd arm is mounted on the 1st arm along with DC motor and encoder.At the end of 2nd arm gripper is fixed. Servo motor is attached to the gripper to hold an object.
